        <h2 class="heading-2">Intro</h2>

        <p id="paragraph-1">Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from
            Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
            "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis
            comprises
            the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in
            Sub-Saharan
            Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species
            are
            also known.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-2">Description</h2>

        <p id="paragraph-2">Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known
            mammals with this
            feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their
            diet
            consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
            animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
            years.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-2">Poaching</h2>

        <p id="paragraph-3">Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese
            traditional medicine)
            and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
            January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica)
            are
            listed as critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
            listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on
            the
            Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
